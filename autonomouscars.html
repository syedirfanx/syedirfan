                                <p><i>In an era of autonomous driving on the future of transportation</i></p>
                            </h1>
                            <h6>By Syed Irfan | April 1, 2020</h6>
                            <hr>

                            <h5>Vehicles or transport systems that execute without the interaction of any human is
                                called Autonomous Driving. For example, Self Driving Cars, which move without any human
                                intervention. The technology of autonomous existed in many forms.The idea of an
                                Autonomous Car was first described by General Motors at New York World’s Fair in 1939.
                                After 19 years in 1958 the self driving car created by General Motors was finally
                                realized. It was one of the greatest innovations in the world of technology. It has too
                                many advantages as well, like it reduces traffic jams, increases human productivity etc.
                                But once it entered the market, the willingness to pay was drifting downwards as not all
                                roads were set up properly for moving autonomous cars. And there were substitutes for
                                this. Autonomous vehicles are not like a must need for people. People were already
                                comfortable with human conducted vehicles. As a result of some uncertainty the
                                willingness to pay for the Autonomous cars decreased without any doubt. But slowly we
                                can see that now Autonomous Cars are directing innovation and will be available in near
                                future. Because of Autonomous driving friendly roads are being constructed. By 2050 half
                                of vehicles of the USA will be autonomous.</h5><br>

                                </p>
                            </div>-->
                            <h5>The autonomous driving was an innovation and a substitution of vehicles which are being
                                conducted by humans. When it first invented they were not sincere about
                                how it moves on the unfair roads. If they did so they also couldn’t solve it
                                immediately. It takes so much time. Still the researcher says that it will take till
                                2050 to make at most 50% vehicles autonomous in the USA.
                                Now-a-days people are comfortable with human conducted vehicles though autonomous
                                vehicles will bring more advantages, as a result of rough roads and too many navigations
                                still it does not get close to fairable percentage. It is true that these vehicles are
                                now available, but these are only available on the fair roads and the percentage of fair
                                roads are too low.
                                Here the principal says that when an innovative product enters the market, the
                                willingness to pay for the product goes downwards because it has some limitations and
                                already the substitute of this product exists.
                                Autonomous driving is not ready yet for it’s prime time. It has many things to improve
                                yet. Lower level autonomy already exists in Audi, Cadillac. Nissan and Tesla already
                                brought semi-autonomous systems.
                                Most of the people in the world don't know about the use of the technology of autonomous
                                driving. This is one of the biggest problems and reasons for the uncertainty and the
                                reason for being drifted down from willingness to pay.

                            </h5><br>
                            <h5>And because of unknown facts people don’t want to take
                                risks which causes uncertainty for the product.
                                Again the optimism with the existing Machine Learning Technology is that autonomous
                                driving will come with a huge change for the welfare of the human society. But all the
                                technology and algorithms of Machine Learning have already been used and still can’t get
                                close to the desired result. Which is another indication of drifting downwards of the
                                willingness to pay.
                                The algorithms are used which are set up by humans and which leads to various dilemmas.
                                There is a debate about the fact that what criteria will be used to move autonomous cars
                                where human lives are at stake. The criteria set up by the human engineers are bound by
                                a framework of actions. So the autonomous is not actually fully autonomous. It is only a
                                part of making our life easier. But making life easier or setting our life to risk, this
                                question affects the innovation which leads to move downwards.

                            </h5><br>
                            <h5>There are some advantages of Autonomous driving. They are -
                                Fewer Accident,
                                Decrease Traffic Jam,
                                Refactor Human Productivity,
                                Tendency of overtaking will be decreased,
                                Competition for the space of parking will be decreased
                                and so on.
                                These will lead to develop the willingness to pay in the near future if they can resolve
                                the issues.
                                Again the Machine Learning technologies are also being improved. Companies like Nissan
                                and Tesla are working on it. Specious fair roads are being constructed with the optimism
                                that within 2050 half of the vehicles of the USA will be autonomous.
                                The world is being prepared for autonomous driving. The self-driving cars are already on
                                the road. The day is not too far that autonomous driving will be available throughout
                                the world.
                                The one person always comes to mind when we discuss autonomous driving, he is Elon Musk.
                                The first company that he starts is Tesla Motors. They are working with the technology
                                of autonomous cars.
                                The technology of autonomous driving will decrease the number of road accidents. The
                                technology here is object detection which detects objects and saves us from unexpected
                                incidents. And this feature undoubtedly increases the willingness to pay.
                                Autonomous driving also decreases traffic jams. Unnecessary parking won’t happen as
                                vehicles would be conducted by machine and it is programmed by humans. As a result it
                                will be time saving and will be preferable to the customers.
                                As a human when he drives he only has to focus on driving. But Autonomous driving can
                                let him not think about driving. Which makes him more productive than before.
                                When vehicles are conducted by humans there is a tendency of overtaking. Which leads to
                                accidents and traffic jams. This tendency will be removed by autonomous driving and will
                                save us from accident and traffic jams.
                                Again when it comes to humans there is also a tendency of getting a parking space
                                quickly than another one books it. It will also decrease when autonomous driving will be
                                available.
